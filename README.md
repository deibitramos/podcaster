# Podcaster App 🎧

This project is a v2 for my previous repo named [podcast-app-challenge](https://github.com/deibitramos/podcast-app-challenge), a code challenge from an interview I had some years ago.

My intention here is to rework this to conform to more current technologies and best practices for React frontend development.

This project features:
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) and [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) replacing Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) replacing a previous approach that combined styled components with Tailwind and also forced MaterialUI (a challenge requirement)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

**Live demo:** [https://podcaster.deibit.dev](https://podcaster.deibit.dev)

Hope you like it :)
