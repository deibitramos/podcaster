# Podcaster

This project will be a v2 for my previous repo named [podcast-app-challenge](https://github.com/deibitramos/podcast-app-challenge), a code challenge from an interview I had some years ago.

My intention here is to rework this to conform to more current technologies and best practices for React frontend development.

This project will feature:
- React 19 & Typescript
- @tanstack/query and Zustand instead of Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
- shadcn/ui and tailwind v4 instead of combining styled components with tailwind and forcing MaterialUI (a challenge requirement)
- @tanstack/router

Hope you like it :)
