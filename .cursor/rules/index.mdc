# Podcaster Project

A podcast search and player application consuming iTunes API data with a custom media player.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Vite 7** with SWC for fast builds
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing with code splitting
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client state management
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with shadcn/ui components
- **Vitest** for testing with MSW for mocking

```

## Key Conventions

### Imports
- Use `@/` path alias for all src imports
- Prefer named exports over default exports (exception: route components)
- Co-locate route-specific code in `-components/` and `-hooks/` directories

### TypeScript
- Use `type` keyword for type definitions (not `interface`)
- Entities are defined in `src/entities/` with re-exports via `index.ts`
- Use strict type checking - no `any` types

### Code Style
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Semicolons required
- 1TBS brace style
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class composition

### File Naming
- React components: PascalCase (`PlayerContent.tsx`)
- Utilities and hooks: camelCase (`useDebounce.ts`, `dates.ts`)
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` next to source files
